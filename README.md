<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Cosmic Chariots is an e-commerce site that allows you to book a trip to space. Similar to booking a cruise ship, the app allows you to make a reservation on a specific launch date, choose your suite, and pick what planet excursions, on-board activities, and dining package you would like to add. You can save your location with your personal information and you will be all set to head for the stars!

This repository contains the app's backend. For frontend, please click [here](https://github.com/space-frontiers/cosmic_chariots_frontend).
